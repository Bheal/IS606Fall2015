## Course Description

This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.

## Course Learning Outcomes:

By then end of the course, students should be able to:

* Understand the foundations of probability theory and perform basic probability calculations.
* Build basic stochastic models for commonly encountered business problems.
* Model situations involving uncertainty using appropriate probability distributions and conditional techniques.
* Explore and summarize data using descriptive statistics.
* Test hypotheses using classical and modern computational techniques.
* Construct estimators and calculate intervals using classical and modern computational techniques.
* Perform basic Bayesian statistical techniques for estimation and testing hypotheses.

## Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:

* Business Understanding.  Learn when probabilistic techniques apply to certain categories of business problems, discuss the sorts of solutions that are possible, and understand the limitations of these techniques.
* Foundational Math Skills. Explore and analyze data, build probabilistic and statistical models, construct estimators, and test hypotheses.
* Predictive Modeling.  Learn foundational techniques that underlie predictive modeling algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes.
* Presentation.  Complete and submit collaborative assignments using techniques from the course.

## How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?

Probabilistic techniques are the foundation of many data science applications from data exploration and visualization to outlier analysis, stochastic modelling, and data mining algorithms. This course will ensure that students have a strong understanding of these foundations.

## How This Course Works:

This course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments to be submitted. There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.

Meetup presentations will comprise the solution and presentation to the class of one of the suggested problems for study from the weekly materials (not the homework problems). Each student must present one problem throughout the semester. Problems are chosen by posting you selection in the appropriate discussion forum in the course. Problems are assigned first come, first served, so any problem not already chosen by another student is available.

Further details on each of these assignments will be available in Blackboard.

## Data Project

For the data project, you are to select an open data source and write a report addresses the following five sections:

1. **Introduction**: What is your research question? Why do you care? Why should others care?

2. **Data**: Write about the data from your proposal in text form. Address the following points:
	* Data collection: Describe how the data were collected.
	* Cases: What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment)
	* Variables: What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable.
	* Type of study: What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how you've arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design.
	* Scope of inference - generalizability: Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability.
	* Scope of inference - causality: Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.

3. **Exploratory data analysis**: Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.

4. **Inference**: If your data fails some conditions and you can't use a theoretical method, then you should use simulation. If you can use both methods, then you should use both methods. It is your responsibility to figure out the appropriate methodology.
	* Check conditions
	* Theoretical inference (if possible) - hypothesis test and confidence interval
	* Simulation based inference - hypothesis test and confidence interval
	* Brief description of methodology that reflects your conceptual understanding  


5. **Conclusion**: Write a brief summary of your findings without repeating your statements from earlier. Also include a discussion of what you have learned about your research question and the data you collected. You may also want to include ideas for possible future research.

You are not to use data sources used in class or the textbooks. Possible data sources:

* RStudio data sources [http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/23/new-data-packages/](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/23/new-data-packages/)
* Analyze Survey Data for Free (ASDFree) has many open data sources that can be used [http://www.asdfree.com/](http://www.asdfree.com/)
* The World Bank Data Catalog [http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/](http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/)
* Google Public Data search engine [http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory](http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
* Vanderbilt data sources [http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets)
* Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA) [http://www.oecd.org/pisa/](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/)
* Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
* World Values Survey
* American National Election Survey (ANES)
* General Social Survey (GSS)


## Software

We will make use of [R](http://r-project.org), an open source statistics program and language. Be sure to [install R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) on your own computers within the first week of the class.

* R - [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [Mac](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* RStudio - [Download Windows or Mac version from here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If using Windows, you also need to download and install these:

* [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.16.3.1603/ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi)

Once everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):

```
install.packages(c('openintro','OIdata','devtools','ggplot2','psych','reshape2',
				   'knitr','markdown'), repos='http://cran.r-project.org')
devtools::install_github("seankross/lego")
```

Here are some resources to help you learn and use R and R Markdown:

* [O'Reilly Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/). Great tutorial on R where you can try R commands directly from the web browser.
* [R Reference Card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
* [Video Overview of RStudio](http://vimeo.com/97166163)
* [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). Markdown is a way of formatting plain text documents mostly for the web. However, it has become for other writing tasks too. It has become popular because it focusses on writing and not formatting. The formatting is taken care later. The [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) provides a nice introduction to Markdown.
* [The R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) has a nice introduction on how Markdown is extended to allow for the inclusion of R code and output.
* [Two page cheat sheet on R Markdown](https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015/blob/master/Resources/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf?raw=true). 
* [Video Introduction to R Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFe1UJrj7lc). This short video (under 4 minutes) was recorded with an older version, so not all of the features and dialog boxes will look the same, but may be helpful.
* [Video on RMarkdown by RStudio](http://vimeo.com/94181521) - This 26 minute video talks about some updates to RMarkdown.

## Contact
