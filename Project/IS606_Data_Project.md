### Project Format

For the data project, you are to select an open data source and write a report addresses the following five sections:

1. **Introduction**: What is your research question? Why do you care? Why should others care?

2. **Data**: Write about the data from your proposal in text form. Address the following points:
	* Data collection: Describe how the data were collected.
	* Cases: What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment)
	* Variables: What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable.
	* Type of study: What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how you've arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design.
	* Scope of inference - generalizability: Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability.
	* Scope of inference - causality: Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.

3. **Exploratory data analysis**: Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.

4. **Inference**: If your data fails some conditions and you can't use a theoretical method, then you should use simulation. If you can use both methods, then you should use both methods. It is your responsibility to figure out the appropriate methodology.
	* Check conditions
	* Theoretical inference (if possible) - hypothesis test and confidence interval
	* Simulation based inference - hypothesis test and confidence interval
	* Brief description of methodology that reflects your conceptual understanding  


5. **Conclusion**: Write a brief summary of your findings without repeating your statements from earlier. Also include a discussion of what you have learned about your research question and the data you collected. You may also want to include ideas for possible future research.
